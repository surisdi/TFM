%"Our objective is to leverage semantic knowledge learned in the text domain, and transfer it to a model
%trained for visual object recognition. We begin by pre-training a simple neural language model well-
%suited for learning semantically-meaningful, dense vector representations of words [13]. In parallel,
%we pre-train a state-of-the-art deep neural network for visual object recognition [11], complete with
%a traditional softmax output layer.  We then construct a deep visual-semantic model by taking the
%lower layers of the pre-trained visual object recognition network and re-training them to predict the
%vector representation of the image label text as learned by the language model. These three training
%phases are detailed below."
