\chapter*{Abstract}

Deep learning models and more specifically computer vision systems have achieved great results in the past years. 

However, the interpretability 

Not only that, but the representations learned by neural networks encompass a much higher level knowledge that has to be approached from a semantic point of view, at a \emph{concept level}.

The goal of this project is to study the concepts neural networks learn
